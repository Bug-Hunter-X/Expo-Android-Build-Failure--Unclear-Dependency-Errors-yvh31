## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to build an Android APK using `expo build:android`.  Observe the error messages.

## Solutions

Refer to `bugSolution.js` for debugging steps and potential solutions, such as:

* Checking and updating dependencies in `package.json`.
* Cleaning and rebuilding the project.
