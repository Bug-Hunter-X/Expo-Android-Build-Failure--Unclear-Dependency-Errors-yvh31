Debugging this error requires careful examination of the complete error message provided by the Expo CLI during the build process.  Here's a systematic approach:

1. **Examine the Full Error Log:** The error messages are often fragmented.  Look for the complete log to identify the root cause more clearly.  The log might point to specific modules or dependencies that are causing conflicts.

2. **Check `package.json` Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible. Run `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update all packages.   Check for any known issues with the versions of your dependencies by searching for the errors you received on Google or within the documentation of the relevant modules.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, cached build files can cause problems.  Try cleaning and rebuilding the project using the following commands:
   ```bash
   expo prebuild --clean
   expo build:android
   ```

4. **Inspect `android/app/build.gradle`:** This file manages your Android build settings.  Look for any errors, misconfigurations, or missing dependencies.  Make sure all necessary plugins and configurations for your native modules are correctly specified.

5. **Simplify the Project:** If the project is complex, try creating a minimal reproducible example.  This will help isolate the source of the problem.

6. **Examine Native Module Configurations:** If you are using native modules, carefully review their documentation and installation instructions.  Ensure they are correctly integrated into your Expo project and compatible with your current setup.

7. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search online forums, Stack Overflow, or the Expo community for similar error messages.  Someone may have already encountered and solved this issue.
